Wheels are great for moving over flat surfances, but if you want to go almost
anywhere on land, it's hard to beat legs.

Legged robots could enable new transportation methods, assist in disaster response,
and help restore mobility to people who have lost it.

Just like [manipulation](/projects/manipulation), people and animals are so good at legged locomotion that we
often underestimate how difficult it is. Despite recent a surge of progress in
legged robotics, numerous thorny questions remain. How can a legged robot use its
whole body -- not just the feet -- to move through the world? What sort of
models do we need to achieve animal-level performance? What are the underlying
principles behind legged locomotion in nature, and what do those look like when
applied to robots?
