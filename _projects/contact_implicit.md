Most things we want robots to do involve contact. Picking stuff up requires
contact. Moving around also requires contact (unless you can fly). 

But most robots today are bad at contact. Roboticists have spent a long time
thinking very hard about how to avoid collisions entirely. And when contact is 
inevitable, as in manipulation and legged locomotion, we usually make strict assumptions
about where (feet only) when (following a predefined sequence) and how (softly
please!) contact occurs. Unsurprisingly, that can [cause problems](https://youtu.be/g0TaYhjpOfo) 
in the real world.

Contact-implicit trajectory optimization aims to fix this by using numerical
optimization to decide when and where to make and break contact.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/forward_push_frames.png" title="robot rolls a ball" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

    optimization. The robot uses rich contact interactions along its arm to move the ball.

If we can solve contact-implicit optimization quickly and reliably, we can use it for
real-time feedback via [Model Predictive
Control (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control).

    </div>

Doing so is easier said than done. Contact introduces a slew of numerical and
modeling challenges, and general-purpose optimizers are typically not up to the
task. Additionally, contact-implicit optimization is highly nonlinear with many
local minima. Finding a globally optimal solution is 
[NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness),
and is probably too much to ask. Even finding a good-enough local optimum 
can be incredibly difficult.
