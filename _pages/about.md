Hi, I'm Vince! I'm interested in applying mathematical models to solve
real-world problems. Recently, that's meant developing optimization-based
planning and control algorithms for high-degree-of-freedom robots like
quadrupeds and manipulators. 

Sometimes my research involves flashy things like
[throwing robots off ladders](https://youtu.be/FRcyfp-9x5o?t=198) to get them to land
on their feet: other times it's more mundane, like getting a robot to
[roll an oversized tennis ball](https://youtu.be/IqxJKbM8_ms?t=26). 

From 2017-2023 I was a PhD student in the [DISCOVER
lab](https://sites.google.com/a/nd.edu/discoverlab/) at Notre
Dame. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the excellent
[Drake](https://drake.mit.edu) team at 
[Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). Before grad school, I
studied physics and violin performance at 
[Goshen College](https://goshen.edu).
