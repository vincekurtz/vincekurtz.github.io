Hi, I'm Vince! I'll be joining [DePaul's School of
Computing](https://www.depaul.edu/) in January 2026. Until then, I'm working
with the [Large Behavior Models](https://www.tri.global/our-work/robotics) team
at Toyota Research Institue.

In my research, I develop planning and control algorithms for
high-degree-of-freedom robots like quadrupeds, humanoids, and manipulators.
Sometimes this involves flashy things like
[throwing robots off ladders](https://youtu.be/FRcyfp-9x5o?t=198) to get them to
land on their feet: other times it's more mundane, like getting a robot to
[fidget with a cube](https://caltech-amber.github.io/drop/).

I previously worked as a postdoc and research scientist in the
[Ames](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/) and 
[Burdick](http://robotics.caltech.edu/) groups at Caltech. From 2017-2023 I was
a PhD student in the
[DISCOVER lab](https://sites.google.com/a/nd.edu/discoverlab/) at Notre
Dame. Before grad school, I
studied physics and violin performance at 
[Goshen College](https://goshen.edu).
