As part of my research, I aim to develop and maintain high-quality open-source code,
  primarily in python and C++.

Software projects that I'm particularly proud of include 
[stlpy](https://stlpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html),
a python library for signal temporal logic, and
[IDTO](https://idto.github.io),
a solver for contact-implicit trajectory optimization.

You can find these projects and more on [github](https://github.com/vincekurtz).
