My research focuses on planning, simulation, and control of
high-degree-of-freedom robots. I'm particularly interested in techniques that
enable safe and reliable **contact-rich interactions** with the environment, as
well as methods that **generalize across legged locomotion and dexterous
manipulation** tasks.
