See [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) documentation for
details.

## Testing Locally

```
docker-compose up
```

## Making updates

Most changes go in the markdown files in `_pages`. Project descriptions are in
`_projects`.

Paper bibtex is in `_bibliography/papers.bib`, including some extra fields for a
preview image, whether a paper is a "selected publication" for the main page, etc.
